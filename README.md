# Predictive-Policing
The goal of this study is to understand how demographic and geographic factors relate to narcotic-related crime in Chicago. In particular, we are interested in knowing whether narcotic-related crimes depend on demographic and geographic factors and whether cannabis and noncannabis-related crimes are correlated. In this study, I present stable, interpretable, theoretically valid regression models to predict narcotic crime in Chicago that address these research questions.
